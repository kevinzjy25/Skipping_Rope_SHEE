CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory G:/Project2025/skipping_rope/Skipping_Rope_SHEE/Firmware/Web_version/build/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory e:/Project_2025/Skipping_Rope_SHEE/Firmware/Web_version/build where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "G:/Project2025/skipping_rope/Skipping_Rope_SHEE/Firmware/Web_version/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "E:/Project_2025/Skipping_Rope_SHEE/Firmware/Web_version/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
